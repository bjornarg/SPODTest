\section{Introduction}
\gls{spodtest} is a suite for testing the transfer speed between sites using 
different protocols, datasets and options. It is made to give users an overview
of which protocols to use when transferring data between sites, and make each
site aware of any problems that might slow down data transfer.  

\gls{spodtest} generates an \gls{xml} document with the resulting data, and a
module has been created for \gls{mapi} \cite{mapidoc} to transfer the data back
to the Metacenter, where the data is gathered and displayed to users.
