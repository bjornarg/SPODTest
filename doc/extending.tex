\section{Extending SPODTest}

\gls{spodtest} can be extended to include tests for more commands if required.
This is done by subclassing the \verb@testers.base.CommandBuilder@ class. These
subclasses define the command itself, how it handles arguments, and can build
any necessary extra files needed for sending the data.

See \verb@testers.sftp@ for a well documented example of how to create such a
class.
