Network speed testing tool
==========================

SPODTest is a simple tool for measuring transfer speeds between
systems using different protocols, options and data sets. The tool is made in
an attempt to measure transfer speeds similar to those that would be seen by
users on the systems. Consequently, it does not use any Python libraries to
test the different protocols, but rather executes separate that would be used
by users.
